# Push Red Color Fix

Back to a classic, balanced red that's not too harsh but still clearly indicates expenses.

```bash
cd /Users/chulhojkim/CascadeProjects/money-clip-mvp
git add frontend/src/pages/SimpleDashboard.tsx
git commit -m "Use classic red color for expenses - balanced approach

- Switch from muted stone back to classic red (#dc2626)
- Not as harsh as original bright red but still clear
- Good contrast with green while being professional
- Better visibility than the too-muted stone color
