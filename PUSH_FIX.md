# Push Plaid Products Fix

The issue was identified! The Plaid configuration was using 'accounts' as a product, but that's not valid. Fixed to use 'auth' instead.

```bash
cd /Users/chulhojkim/CascadeProjects/money-clip-mvp
git add backend/plaid_config.py
git commit -m "Fix Plaid products configuration

- Change invalid 'accounts' product to 'auth' 
- Add 'auth' to PRODUCTS list for account information
- This resolves the ApiValueError causing 500 errors

git push
```

## The Fix:
- Changed `'accounts'` to `'auth'` in Plaid products
- `'auth'` provides account information and is a valid Plaid product
- `'transactions'` provides transaction history

## After pushing:
1. Railway will redeploy (2-3 minutes)
2. Test the endpoint: https://clip-mvp-production.up.railway.app/api/debug/plaid-test
3. Should now return success instead of error
4. "Import Data" should work in the app!
