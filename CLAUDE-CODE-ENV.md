### Development Preferences

#### Technology Stack Decisions
- **React + TypeScript**: Type safety without complexity overhead
- **Material-UI**: Rapid prototyping with professional aesthetics
- **Flask/FastAPI**: Lightweight backends that scale
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database flexibility with ORM convenience
- **Railway/Vercel**: Deploy-first infrastructure choices

#### Code Quality Standards
- **No comments unless absolutely necessary**: Self-documenting code
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only what adds real value
- **Production-ready from day one**: No "we'll fix this later"
- **AI-augmented development**: Claude integration in core workflows

## Task Management Protocol

### Planning Approach
```markdown
## Quick Plan Format
**Goal**: [Single sentence outcome]
**Timeline**: [Hours/days, not weeks]
**Success Metrics**: [Measurable user impact]
**Trade-offs**: [What we're NOT doing]
**Next**: [Immediate next action]
```

### Progress Tracking
- **Daily artifacts**: Screenshots, metrics, user feedback
- **Weekly snapshots**: Updated MVP_SNAPSHOT.md with key metrics
- **Bi-weekly retrospectives**: What's working, what isn't, course corrections

### Todo Management
- Use TodoWrite tool proactively for complex tasks (3+ steps)
- Mark tasks complete immediately upon finishing
- Break large features into shipping increments
- Always have "next immediate action" identified

## User Experience Philosophy

### Design Principles
- **Speed of understanding**: User gets value in seconds, not minutes
- **AI-powered insights**: Every interaction enhanced by Claude
- **Neon/gaming aesthetics**: Bold, confident, futuristic feel
- **Mobile-first**: Works perfectly on phone before desktop
- **One-click workflows**: Minimize cognitive overhead

### Feature Development
1. **MVP First**: Simplest possible version that delivers value
2. **User feedback loop**: Ship → Measure → Learn → Iterate
3. **AI enhancement**: How can Claude make this 10x better?
4. **Support integration**: How do we help users succeed?

## Claude Integration Standards

### Core AI Features (Always Include)
- **Transaction categorization**: Instant, confident suggestions
- **Spending insights**: Daily personalized recommendations  
- **Anomaly detection**: Unusual patterns flagged immediately
- **Natural language queries**: "How much did I spend on food?"
- **Predictive budgeting**: AI-suggested spending limits

### Implementation Patterns
```python
# Always include confidence scores
def ai_categorize(description: str) -> Dict:
    return {
        'category': 'Food',
        'confidence': 0.95,
        'reasoning': 'Whole Foods is a grocery store',
        'alternative_suggestions': ['Groceries', 'Health']
    }
```

### API Design
- Mock responses for development speed
- Real Claude integration configurable via environment
- Graceful degradation when AI unavailable
- User approval workflows for all AI actions

## Metrics & Growth Framework

- **Net Promoter Score**: Would users recommend us?

### Weekly Artifact Generation
```markdown
## Week X Progress Report
**Users**: [Growth vs previous week]
**Revenue**: [If applicable]
**Key Features Shipped**: [User-facing improvements]
**AI Enhancement Metrics**: [Claude feature usage]
