# Push Color Changes

The red colors have been updated to a much more muted stone/taupe color but need to be deployed.

```bash
cd /Users/chulhojkim/CascadeProjects/money-clip-mvp
git add frontend/src/pages/SimpleDashboard.tsx
git commit -m "Replace harsh red with muted stone color for expenses

- Change bright red (#ef4444) to warm stone (#78716c)
