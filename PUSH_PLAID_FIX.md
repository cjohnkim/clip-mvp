# Push to remote
git push
```

## What this fixes:
- Adds the missing `plaid-python` library to production
- Resolves the "demo mode" issue you were seeing
- Enables real Plaid bank connections

## After pushing:
1. Railway will automatically redeploy (2-3 minutes)
2. Test "Import Data" at https://app.moneyclip.money
3. Should open real Plaid Link instead of demo message

## Files changed:
- âœ… `backend/requirements.txt` - Added plaid-python==8.1.0
- âœ… `backend/app.py` - Added debug endpoint

The issue was that the Plaid Python library wasn't installed in production, causing it to fall back to mock/demo mode.
